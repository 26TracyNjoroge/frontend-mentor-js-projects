# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

This is my solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI).

## Overview

### The challenge
This project is an interactive rating component that a user rates between 1-5 and after submitting there is a thank you component that appears. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

It is a good project for practicing user interactions and updating the DOM.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learnt

- **Event delegation**: Using one event listener to handle multiple elements instead of individual listeners for each element
- **Data flow management**: Storing and passing data between different components using variables
- **CSS selectors**: Using attribute selectors like `label[for=${id}]` to find related elements

### Continued development

### Challenges faced

- Understanding how `event.target` works and how to identify which specific element triggered an event
- Learning how to connect HTML elements (radio inputs and their corresponding labels)
- Managing data flow between the rating selection and thank you components
- Implementing proper cleanup (removing classes from all elements before adding to the selected one)
