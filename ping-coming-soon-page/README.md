# Frontend Mentor - Ping Coming Soon Page

This is my solution to the [Ping coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da).

## Overview

### The challenge
This project is a Ping coming soon page that a user inputs an email in the email address input section, receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
- The input field is empty
-The email address is not formatted correctly

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
